"""
    batches(data[...]; [count], [size])

Create a vector of `count` equally sized `DataSubset` of size
`size` by partitioning the given `data` in their current order.
In the case that the size of the dataset is not dividable by
the specified (or inferred) size, the remaining observations will
be ignored.

```julia
for x in batches(X, count = 10)
    # code called 10 times
    # nobs(x) won't change over iterations
end
```

Using `shuffled` one can also have batches with randomly
assigned observations

```julia
for x in batches(shuffled(X), count = 10)
    # ...
end
```

Or alternatively just process the statically assigned batches in
random order.

```julia
for x in shuffled(batches(X, count = 10))
    # ...
end
```

Multiple variables are supported (e.g. for labeled data).

```julia
for (x,y) in batches(X, Y, size = 20)
    @assert nobs(x) == 20
    @assert nobs(y) == 20
    # ...
end
```

"""
    splitobs(data[...]; at = 0.7)

Splits the data into multiple subsets. Not that this function will
performs the splits statically and not perform any randomization.
The function creates a vector `DataSubset` in which the first
N-1 elements/subsets contain the fraction of observations of `data`
that is specified by `at`.

For example if `at` is a Float64 then the vector contains two elements.
In the following code the first subset `train` will contain 70% of the
observations and the second subset `test` the rest.

```julia
train, test = splitobs(X, at = 0.7)
```

If `at` is a tuple of `Float64` then additional subsets will be created.
In this example `train` will have 50% of the observations, `val` will
have 30% and `test` the other 20%

```julia
train, val, test = splitobs(X, at = (0.5, 0.3))
```

It is also possible to call it with multiple data arguments,
which all have to have the same number of total observations.
This is useful for labeled data.

```julia
train, test = splitobs(X, y, at = 0.7)
(x_train,y_train), (x_test,y_test) = splitobs(X, y, at = 0.7)
```

If the observations should be randomly assigned to a subset,
then you can combine the function with `shuffled`

```julia
train, test = splitobs(shuffled(X,y), at = 0.7)
```
